# Mercury-Pong
Pong game made in C++ with SFML

It's a school project from 2012 made for the end of the year project.

What's special about this pong is that the ball's interaction are really different.
Each time a ball hits something, it splits in two parts, making it really difficult when there's a ton of balls on the screen.
